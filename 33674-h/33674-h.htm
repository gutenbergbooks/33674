<p>
<i>My dear Cornwall Hollis</i>:<br />
</p>

<p><i>With the Allied cause crumbling away it is high time
we thought of aesthetics. As a triste jest I said that to
you the other day, and your reply was a plea to let you
write a preface for a new edition of my forgotten Sonnets
from the Patagonian. I am at last persuaded, and who but
you should do the preface?</i></p>

<p><i>With Mitteleuropa a fact it should be apparent to any
honest, thinking man that we are losing the War. Perhaps,
in a larger sense, we have already lost the War and the
dusk of the Anglo-Saxon is come. Then we are at last
joined with the H&eacute;llenes and Latins in the descending
scale, and it is the Teuton now approaching the perihelion,
with the Slav, yet to conquer, in the far distance. But
that is an eye-survey for eternity, and we have merely to
do with the finite present. So we may still think of
resistance, and not yet abandon hope of postponing defeat.</i></p>

<p><i>It is now the hour for the supreme test of America, and
she too must fail, as our Allies have failed, before the Huns
unless somewhere she can find the beauty and the strength
of the human soul with which to give battle. For the first
time in history it is souls, not guns, that will win the War,
and remember, my dear friend, that Beauty is more necessary
than food that the soul may live.</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span></p>

<p><i>We are all but engulfed in error. We say that we do not
hate the German people; it is the Kaiser we are fighting.
A pitiful self-delusion! It must be the German people we
hate as an overshadowing race, if our fight is to have even
the excuse of the inflamed passion of the survival of the
fittest. We must acknowledge the Kaiser as the symbol of
the best organized form of government, unless we are
frankly anarchists; the most efficient, the most powerful,
the most nearly approaching a practical socialism. Let us,
therefore, start afresh. We hate the German people, for
they have threatened our complacent supremacy as lords
of the world. Now we are at least truthful.</i></p>

<p><i>Thus far, the Allies have failed signally as a military
force. The Europeans have forgotten how to fight, and we
in America have never learned. We have put too much
faith in materialism, and betrayed the Soul and Beauty.
There is more to life than living, and more to an army than
arms. The moment is here that demands we scrap the
military leaders, as such, and seek stronger. Why not then
turn to the Poets to direct the War, for, lo! it was the
Poets who in seven days won the Irish Revolution. None
knows better than you how I begrudge giving the ever-turbulent
West Britons any praise, any glory, but there is
the simple truth. They vanquished the foe because they
first had conquered fear, and then nought could stand
against them.</i></p>

<p><i>If we could purge ourselves of our fear of Germany we
should capture Berlin. Could I enlist a Battalion of Irreproachables,
whose uniforms should be walking suit, top hat
and pumps, and their only weapon an ebony stick, and sail
tomorrow, we should march down Unter den Linden in a
month, provided wrapped in our kerchiefs we carried the
Gospel of Beauty, and a nonchalance in the knot of our
cravats.</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Verily, verily, men are killed solely because they fear
death, and turn their backs on Beauty, for only ugliness
and error can destroy, and ugliness in the end destroys
itself.</i></p>

<p><i>There is really no horror in the War. Even in the
ridiculous way we are now fighting it is all a shabby, stupid
sham. That chap Griffith gave us a more realistic spectacle
in "The Birth of a Nation." Far too few men are actually
killed and wounded, and the job is much too large for the
materialists. They do not know how to employ effectively
the huge forces they have raised into being.</i></p>

<p><i>If somehow we can grope our way back to the springs
of Beauty all may yet be saved, but it will require the
sacrifice of everything we have. For myriads it will mean
the offering of their lives, for that is all they possess, and
it must be done freely, gladly, with their souls purified,
if it is to avail anything. Pride, ambition, selfishness, self-will
must go, or we perish blind miserables.</i></p>

<p><i>For myself, you know I am willingly in service as a
common soldier, although some years beyond conscription
age. Ungrudgingly I gave up alcohol&mdash;almost a lifelong
necessity&mdash;and for months I, the Epicurean, have been
dispassionately measuring the supposed hardships of war
that I might truly understand what a soldier has to
undergo. With Beauty in the bloodbeat privation is nothing.
What can touch me now except the amusing joy of
giving up for the common good? Yet who actually loves
humankind less than I? But the subordination idea intrigues
me, possesses me, satisfies me. How better can I
prove my patent of snobbery and my innate right cordially
to dislike my fellowmen?</i></p>

<p><i>The social degradation involved in functioning as an
enlisted man was and, of course, is the worst of the annoyances.
I am neither young enough nor sufficiently democratic</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span><i>
to enjoy day after day a below-stairs status. It is a
trial, I confess, but I venture to persuade myself that I do
all that is required of me with admirable abasement and
detachment. Occasionally, indeed, it is capital fun to play
the anonymous cipher. I am often urged to obtain a commission.
But I cannot quite do that, for would not that be
a confession that I hadn't the pluck to stick it out? I must
remain as I am. Many of my contemporaries are finding
the khaki an easy means of increasing their literary reputations.
Wise brothers, ye have chosen your r&ocirc;les. I prefer
mine.</i></p>

<p><i>Before you have seen my book through the press I may
be dead. With all my heart I hope I shall not come back,
for then impersonally I shall have fallen for a cause in
which I have no faith. What more distinguished end for
an incurable poseur? Have I not been called that? Plant,
I beg you, mignonette to encircle my arrowroot fields.</i></p>

<p><i>What has all this to do with the Sonnets from the Patagonian?
If you will read my words aright they will give
the key to my poems, should you, my beloved Hollis, still
lack a key. The volume when it first appeared was not
liked by divers nice people&mdash;it was thought nasty&mdash;but
none put it down till he had finished it; a terror was on
him lest he miss a word. And the terror was the Sword
of Beauty which slayeth all. Intrepidity....</i></p>

<p><i>But you shall interpret the poems yourself.</i></p>

<p>
<i>DONALD EVANS.</i><br />
</p>


<p><i>I have broken my engagement to write a preface, but
have given you, gentle Reader, the Poet's letter instead.</i></p>
